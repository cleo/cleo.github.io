## Cleo Connector  - Sample Projects

Here are some sample projects you can use as the basis for your own projects.

[Random Connector](https://github.com/cleo/connector-random) - a basic example of a connector providing a kind of virtual file whose contents are a random, but predictable based on a provided seed sequence of bytes.

[ZIPBox Connector](https://github.com/cleo/connector-zipbox) - expanding on the Random Connector sample project, provides support for handling ZIP archives as if they were expanded folders.
